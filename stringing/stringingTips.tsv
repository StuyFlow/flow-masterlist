Beginner	Timing refers to the pattern of downbeats. A downbeat is when the poi points downward (6 o'clock). Same time refers to when both poi perform a downbeat at the same time. Split time refers to when each poi performs alternating downbeats (when one is pointed up, the other is pointed down).	Direction refers to the direction in which the poi are spinning. When you first start, "forward" refers to the poi spinning away from you while "backwards" or "reverse" refers to the poi spinning towards you. Different directions will be described as you advance more.	Planes refer to how "tilted" the poi are when they are spinning. Wheel plane refers to the poi spinning to the sides of your body, such as in 3 beat or buzzsaw. Wall plane refers to the poi spinning in front of you, parallel to your body, such as in windmill. Practicing to make sure your planes are straight (perpendicular or parallel to your body) is essential to clean moves.	The most commmon way to hold glowsticks in StuyFlow is to put the string over your middle finger and pinch the string with your thumb and index finger. This allows you to have control over the string while also "letting out" as much string as possible.	If you have trouble with controlling 2 poi when you're trying to focus on only one, then wrap one in your hand while spinning the other. You can still go through the motions with your hands as if the poi is not wrapped. TL;DR: practice one hand at a time.
Intermediate	Cardinals refer to where the poi is in wall plane (East, West, North, or South). Almost every wall plane flower can be described using these cardinals. For example, a 4 petal antispin does a "spin" at each cardinal while frontals do a spin at the North, South, and either East or West. It's important to make sure that the moves you learn that can apply to cardinals have elements that are on their respective cardinal for clean flow. You can use a mirror to achieve this.	Antispin/Inspin theory is a topic that is introduced to intermediate stringers but is the foundation for many advanced moves. In short, antispins are when the poi and the arm are moving in different directions. Inspins are when the poi and the arm are moving in the same direction.	An antispin flower with N petals has N - 1 downbeats. For example, even though a 4 petal antispin has 4 petals, it only has 3 downbeats (North, East, and West). An inspin flower with N petals has N + 1 downbeats. This also means that flowers can be performed in split and same time. For example, crosser frontals are a split time move composed of identical antispins (just count the downbeats!).	Use a wall and a mirror. Short tip, but it'll help to clean flow immensely.	
Advanced	9 square theory is essentially just an expanded form of cardinal theory. Imagine a tic-tac-toe board in front of you. Many moves such as CAPs are harder to describe using cardinals but because 9 square theory divides the plane into more sections, it's easier to describe the movements. Also, 9 square theory can make it easier to determine the points of transition between two different moves. Generally, geometric poi spinning looks better than unsymmetrical poi spinning so 9 square theory can help clean that. Also, 9 square theory is used a lot in the "tech" poi world which focuses on drawing patterns from math into flow.	In more advanced flow, it's common to see many combinations of different moves called hybrids. Expanding on Antispin/Inspin theory, hybrids allow you to mash together two moves that don't seem like they should belong together. They take advantage of two different moves that have the same number of beats to create interesting patterns. For example, a 4 petal antispin and a 3 beat both each have 3 beats which allow you to split time them. A more familiar example would be Antispins vs. Inspins. In short, if a move has the same number of beats as another, it's probably possible to do them both at the same time! Note that the number of beats isn't the only factor that goes into creating hybrids. You can always slow a move down to match it up with another move (ex. Mercedes/Triquetra, a 1 beat extension vs a 2 beat antispin flower).	If you have the willpower, it pays off to learn the reverse of every move. It will help your understanding of each move and allow you to incorporate them into your flow more easily. It forces you to break the move down to its constituant parts and really understand how the move works. If you understand every part of the move, you'll notice a lot of patterns between moves that might not occur to you at first (helps with transitions!). If you struggle with freestyling try this.
