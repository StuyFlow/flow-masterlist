Beginner	When lacing, you always have to start from the base of the fiber and work your way towards the about 5/6th of the way to the end of the fiber. This creates a very full-looking lace. You don't want to go all the way to the tip because it is hard to do when you're going very fast and it limits your mobility for the rest of your combination.	Whip fibers don't glide well on cotton or fiber clothing! Fibers glide best on nylon, so it's helpful to wear a windbreaker or jacket when flowing. Sweat also sticks to fibers, which makes whipping on bare skin in the summer very difficult.	Consider investing in flow grease to combat some of the issues you might have with fibers getting stuck to your skin/clothes.
Intermediate	Experiment with different combinations of laces and body movements! You don't have to and shouldn't stand still when whipping!	Make sure your moves are big and full, but make sure you have ample space to perform the moves as well.	Make mental notes of your spin direction! It can be easy to try to transition into a move and realize you're spinning in the complete wrong direction. Wraps and stalls are your best friend!
Advanced	The suicide wrap isn't difficult once you get past the fear of doing it for the first time! You just want to move your neck/head in the direction of the spin, as this will propel the whip and create a clean wrap. Always be aware of your surroundings when performing this move!	Whip isolations are a lot easier to perform than poi isolations, just make sure to move your arm with the whip so that you shift the center of rotation of your whip. To get a feel of what isolations look like, grab the handle of the whip in one hand and grip the center of the fiberhead in the other hand, and start rotating the whip as if you were pedaling a bike. Isolations look really good for rotating around your arms, legs, and neck!	Lots of poi moves can be done on whips using fiber-wielding techniques. Try experimenting with what poi moves you can analogically transfer to the whip!
