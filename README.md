# _The_ Masterlist of Flow Moves
An online resource for Flowers of all skill levels to enhance their Flow!

## Motivation
With COVID-19, the teaching of Flow at Stuyvesant's [StuyFlow](https://www.facebook.com/StuyFl0w/) has gone virtual. Because teaching Flow over Zoom is much more difficult than in person, I decided to create a website to supplement virtual learning. I aimed for this website to be a one-stop shop for anyone who is struggling with a move or wants to learn something new.

## Website Structure
The website is divided between 3 of the main props taught at StuyFlow: **Staffing**, **Stringing**, and **Whipping**. Each section contains tips for each skill level as well as a chart that contains a recommended sequence of moves to learn for their respective prop. From the chart, users can click on specific moves to get more information.
Each move contains
* A designated difficulty
* An embedded video demonstration
* Various tips
* Links to YouTube tutorials
* A list of related moves, if applicable

Each move can also be accessed through the **Search** tab.
