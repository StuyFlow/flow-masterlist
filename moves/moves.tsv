2 beat	1	A simple weave, with each poi doing one downbeat on opposite sides of the body	Try to keep the poi perpendicular to the floor and parallel to the sides of your body	As you get more comfortable, try to spin slower	It is encouraged to learn both the "left hand over" & "right hand over" variations (refer to video)	Dont be afraid to exaggerate your arm movements as much as possible so you dont hit yourself when the poi crosses to the other side (applies to all other weaves and n beat moves)	Drexfactor	https://youtu.be/hanrZuOio5c					3 beat	Buzzsaw		no video yet	Weaves
Buzzsaw	1	Both poi spin in the same direction in split time to the side of the body	Try to keep the poi perpendicular to the floor and parallel to each other	The poi should be spinning in split time; when one poi is pointing down, the other is pointing up	Its easier to start learning the move with shorter poi; we can do this by partially wrapping the poi in our arms (applies to corkscrew)		Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPFYB4iAv2g								https://www.youtube.com/embed/PtKxrXvECJ0	Weaves
Butterfly	1	Same time, same direction done with both hands together	The planes of each hand are on a slight slant to prevent the poi from hitting each other	Start with your hands farther apart and work your way to getting them right next to each other	It may be easier to learn the move in split time first so the poi dont hit each other, then purposely let the timing sync up until you get into same time		Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxjROR4VwDU	Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiBei0PGjvw						https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRon1qTNlHY	Other
Reel Turn	1	Both poi switch spin direction through the turning the body	Point your wrists down while turning	This move is in same time so both poi should point downwards at the same time	Practice two beat spins with either hand pointing to either the left or the ride side of your body until you are able to move the motions closer to your body (applies to windmill and watermill)		Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXu9rXZGKm0	Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-8yrkHEbQ			Chase the Sun			https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOSicr4bs28	Transitions

Windmill	2	A two beat weave done above the head in wall plane	Because this is one of the first moves that is learned in wall plane, it will take time to get used to spinning your poi without slanting	One of the most difficult parts of this move is getting it into split time. Count beats in your head if it helps.	Most of the move should be done through wrist movement	You can do same time shoulder reels first, and then purposely let the timing unsync untill you get into split time (applies to hip reels in watermill)	Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKdWI3PYqGs	Drexfactor (1 min)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmwQYLokqNA	Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o_kPvsXgqA	Corkscrew	Fountain	Vitruvian	https://www.youtube.com/embed/C45qgsE9gyE	Weaves

Fountain	3	A combination of the forward and reverse 3 beat and windmill	A difficult part of this move is the transition from r3b to windmill. If you end your r3b in front of you, the windmill should start behind you and vice versa.	Spend as much time as you need at each section of the fountain.

staffing	
2 beat	2	One of the basic moves; the staff makes 2 down beats on each side of the arm. Has both forward and reverse directions.	Count each time an end of the staff passes your arm; there should be two consecutive passes on each side of the arm	Divide the move into 4 postitions: (thumb end inside far/pinky end outside close)/(thumb end inside close/pinky end outside far)/(thumb end outside far/pinky end inside close)/(thumb end outside close pinky end inside far)	Keep your arm as straight as possible so that you don't hit yourself.								Flares	Vitruvian	Pinwheel	https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlPKIKAaELw	Wrist Rotation
3 beat	3	The other basic move; the staff makes three down beats on each side of the body.	Curl the staff so it can lie flat on your palm and forearm; once in this position/move the staff to a vertical position	Move your shoulder back/and uncurl the staff until your hand is fist down and palm facing out	Twist your body in order to bring the pinky end of the staff to the front of your body first/then repeat from beginning								CAPs	Basic Toss	Around the World	https://www.youtube.com/embed/QAUqZUhJrRs	Arm Movement/Wrist Rotation
Around the World	4	This move passes the staff around the body with 3 beat.	Practice 3 beat on both left and right hands. This move uses 3 beat to transition between the front and the back of the body	Practice passing separately; get into the motion of passing an object around your body	Don't think of it as passing it to your other hand think of it as handing to it mid rotation.								Basic Tosses	Pinwheel		https://www.youtube.com/embed/kI_LpMCEbHU	Arm Movement/Wrist Rotation
Flares	4	Transitioning between forward and reverse 2 beat on each side of the body	Try to exaggerate the transition at first; instead of going directly across the body/draw a circle with the tip of the staff.	Start transitioning when your palm is facing up.	When starting out fully pivoting on your toes to exagerate the position helps. As you become more comfortable with the movement stop pivoting to make it look smoother								Circles			https://www.youtube.com/embed/6v2K3ZQB420	Arm Movement/Wrist Rotation
CAPs	3	On the side of the body; staff spins up and down	It's literally the second half of 3 beat; instead of curling it up in front of your body/curl it up and down at the side of your body	Focus on the positioning of your elbows so the roation of the staff doesn't hit your inner arm and stop. Make sure the staff passes your forearm on the indised of your body.	For a cleaner looking cap, learn how to stop your staff when it's perfectly vertical. A fast movement into a stiff vertical position is ideal.								Around the World			https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAnblyitE6o	Wrist Rotation/Isolation
Circles	6	A 2 beat while the arm moves in a circle	Start 2 beat first/when comfortable/start moving the arm in the same direction the staff is spinning	Try to keep the speed of both the arm and the staff steady	Make sure to extend your arms wide for a decently sized circle. Exaggerate the width as much as you can, but make sure that you don't forgoe technique as a result!								Flares			https://www.youtube.com/embed/MD7EFwfWto0	Arm Movement/Wrist Rotation
Pinwheel	3	A pinwheel but the pass in front is above your head	Instead of completing the 3 beat/use CAPs to bring the staff above your head/then use 2 beat to pass between your hands	This movement should be very fluid to give the illusion of undisturbed rotation. Practice fluidity before practicing speed.	While learning this move by stopping for a second when you reach the top is good to get the movement down, when doing this movement in shows you want to eliminate that pause as much as possible. It helps to loosen your grip slightly or move your arm with the staff as it continues down the pinwheel.								Helicopter			https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTGx_bnmiAc	Arm Movement/Wrist Rotation
Helicopter	4	Spinning a staff on an open palm horizontally over your head	Looking up at your hand may help it be more horizontal.	Try to balance it for as long as you can by tilting your palm back and forth.	Speed actually helps with balance in this case. A faster spinning staff is easier to balance because it's carrying its own weight a little bit when it's spinning faster. 								Pinwheel			https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HxlXewWvhI	Wrist Rotation
1 beat	1	One down beat on each side of the arm	Each end of the staff does not pass to the other side of the arm; each end of the staff stays on its side of the arm.	Basically pen spinning/except its with a 3ft long stick and your arm	The wrist is more important in this movement than the arm. It's actually a great move to do if you're aiming to increase wrist fluidity and speed. 								Corkscrew	Windmill		https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7Q-RaDR5zw	Wrist Rotation
Corkscrew	2	A horizontal 1 beat	Make sure the ends of the staff don't cross your arm.	Keep your wrist loose, that's the primary location of movement. 	This is another great move to practice when aiming to increase wrist fluidity and improve planes with your wrist.								Corkscrew Toss			https://www.youtube.com/embed/rG3JiAhWe4w	Wrist Rotation
Windmill	2	A 1 beat around your head	One end of the staff should pass in front of your head/and the other end should pass behind your head.	Move your hand back and forth instead of your head.	To get used to contorting your arm the way you need to, start by placing your hand near the end of the staff you're spinning from. That way, the staff becomes more like a string and your arm can perform the contortion easier. From there, move your hand closer to the middle of the staff as you get used to it.								Vitruvian			https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVgpGryazg0	Wrist Rotation
Vitruvian	2	A windmill but you extend out.	Extend your arm as much as possible.	This movement looks best with large, emphasized circles, much like the stringing version of this move, so don't forget that when you're performing.	Placing your hand a little farther away from the center of the staff helps a little bit with this.								Double Vitruvian			https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fp1J8cyPtbs	Arm Movement/Wrist Rotation
Basic Toss	4	Throw a staff in the air while it spins parallel to your body	Enter from 3 beat; wait until the staff is parallel to the ground/then push upwards	Don't just flick your hand because it'll make the staff spin faster but it won't go as high	The wrist controls the spin, while the arm controls the height. It's a good combination of the two that gets you clean tosses.								Corkscrew Toss	Under Leg Toss	The Big Yeet	https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ox9peZ8X644	Tossing
Corkscrew Toss	5	Throw a staff in the air from corkscrew	Start in corkscrew; when your palm is facing up/push upwards.	Just like a regular toss, your arm controls the height while your wrist controls the spins. Keeping the two in balance will get you a successful toss and easy catch.	Again, keep your wrist loose for fluidity.								Basic Toss	Corkscrew		https://www.youtube.com/embed/GUZm-ydPXww	Wrist Rotation/Tossing
Under Leg Toss	7	A pass under your leg into a toss	A regular toss/except you spin the staff under your leg and then toss	Don't over-complicate this move. It really is just a toss from under your leg. The same technique applies, just lift your leg in the process.									Basic Toss			https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6qjcLsy9pQ	Tossing
The Big Yeet	10	Yeet the staff across a large distance to another person	Synchronize with your partner and hope for the best	You need to not only be in sync with your partner to the T if you hope to pull this off, but you need to practicing positioning, spacing, and toss height. Everything a good staff tossed does well is essential to pulling off this move.	This move is the definition of "high risk, high reward." That being said, you're going to want this move to take center stage when you do it in a set, otherwise there isn't a point in risking so much for it.

No Beat Toss	6	A staffing emulation of stringing No Beat	Hold on to the end of the staff and spin them so they are opposite to each other	When your arms are going to cross/toss the staff in the hand that is approaching from the bottom/then move that hand on top and catch the same end of the staff												https://www.youtube.com/embed/ey0hKktzI5k	Tossing
Scissors	7	Same time opposite 4 beat antispins	The thumb end of the staffs are always nearly touching each other										4 Petal Antispin			no video yet	Other
Spin Toss	9	Toss the staff, spin yourself quickly, then catch the staff.	The key here is to spin in the same direction you're throwing the staff. In other words, don't toss the staff from your right hand, then spin towards the left. Spin in the direction of the arm you toss from, that way you and the staff are spinning together	A decently sized toss is needed to pull this move off. Give yourself time to spin completely, then stop and balance yourself before you catch your toss.	Toss as STRAIGHT in the air as possible, and spin as tightly as you can so you don't wander away from your original position.

Leg Lacing	3	Essentially a lace around the leg	You are essentially taking a body lace and transferring to a leg, your hand movements stay the same or similar! Don't overthink it	Once you have learned your torso and leg lace, practice transitioning to and from both. 	You can perform this move on one or both legs		StuyFlow	https://youtu.be/N4U-1Apvpd8?t=1363	Fiberflies	https://youtu.be/gg3tucQ-S24						https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8drbpbJG30	Body-Lacing
Cross Leg Lacing	3	A beginner transition from one leg to the other. Feels like you are weaving the whip back and forth. 	Remember the concept of the Open Torso Position, the Open Position can be used in any type of lacing move; when you are able to go to Open position, you will be able to move your hands and close on another body part to finish your transition!				Fiberflies	https://youtu.be/gg3tucQ-S24								https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8drbpbJG30	Body-Lacing
Elbow Lacing	1	A beginner move which is mostly used as a transition around the body in which you lace the whip up your arm and around the elbow.	This is mainly used to transition from your torso lace to upper-body laces in a smooth manner				Fiberflies	https://youtu.be/Brg2U10vPXc								https://www.youtube.com/embed/D77Hp9WdR5g	Body-Lacing
Arm Lacing	1	Essentially a lace around the arm	This move looks good if you continously lace while moving your arm around your body, otherwise it is mainly used as a transition.	To avoid tangling your whip, make your circles large												no video yet	Body-Lacing
Neck Lacing	5	Essentially a lace around the neck.	To make this move look snazzier, we usually use the elbow lace to transition into the neck lace and raise our elbows again to transition out of this move.	This move can easily get caught in neck sweat and can chafe your skin so it helps to protect your neck.

Khandys Hoe Drop	5	Slowly squat down with knees outwards and wrap from right knee to left knee (or vice versa)	Release your inner Khandy. 	Maintain a wide squat (if you're comfortable with it!)

Torso Lacing	3	This move is extremely important and central to all Body-Lacing moves. A basic/smooth wrap around the waist.	It is important to NOT let go of the whip handle; the handle should always stay in your dominant hand.	Make sure you are attentive visually; you may think you are doing the right thing when you aren't.	Once you can do lace by gripping with your fingers, slowly transition to lacing with your WRIST; this will create for smoother/flowier laces.	This move is extremely important and central to all Body-Lacing moves.

Knee Lacing	5	A lace around a bent-knee while kicking out when the time is right to create a mix between a lace and a lash	Repeat the move to see when the timing is good for you! 	Make sure you tuck/bend your knee to the extreme so the whip can wrap well			Fiberflies	https://youtu.be/o37DvJ6gzvI								https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gi_se3dzFKE	Body-Lacing/Whiplash
