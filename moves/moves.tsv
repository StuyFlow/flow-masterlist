2 beat	1	A simple weave, with each poi doing one downbeat on opposite sides of the body	Try to keep the poi perpendicular to the floor and parallel to the sides of your body	As you get more comfortable, try to spin slower	It is encouraged to learn both the "left hand over" & "right hand over" variations (refer to video)	Dont be afraid to exaggerate your arm movements as much as possible so you dont hit yourself when the poi crosses to the other side (applies to all other weaves and n beat moves)	Drexfactor	https://youtu.be/hanrZuOio5c					3 beat	Buzzsaw		a
Buzzsaw	1	Both poi spin in the same direction in split time to the side of the body	Try to keep the poi perpendicular to the floor and parallel to each other	The poi should be spinning in split time; when one poi is pointing down, the other is pointing up	Its easier to start learning the move with shorter poi; we can do this by partially wrapping the poi in our arms (applies to corkscrew)		Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPFYB4iAv2g								https://www.youtube.com/embed/PtKxrXvECJ0
Butterfly	1	Same time, same direction done with both hands together	The planes of each hand are on a slight slant to prevent the poi from hitting each other	Start with your hands farther apart and work your way to getting them right next to each other	It may be easier to learn the move in split time first so the poi dont hit each other, then purposely let the timing sync up until you get into same time		Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxjROR4VwDU	Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiBei0PGjvw						https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRon1qTNlHY
Reel Turn	1	Both poi switch spin direction through the turning the body	Point your wrists down while turning	This move is in same time so both poi should point downwards at the same time	Practice two beat spins with either hand pointing to either the left or the ride side of your body until you are able to move the motions closer to your body (applies to windmill and watermill)		Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXu9rXZGKm0	Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-8yrkHEbQ			Chase the Sun			https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOSicr4bs28
Corkscrew	1	A two beat weave done in floor plane	Your hands should be pointing in opposite directions at all times	Imagine each poi making a figure 8, alternating between top and bottom.

3 beat	2	A simple weave, with each poi doing one downbeat on one side of the body and two downbeats on the opposite side of the body	Try to keep the poi perpendicular to the floor and parallel to the sides of your body	As you get more comfortable, try to spin slower	This also applies to 2 beat weaves, but imagine each poi tracing the lines of an "X" when they go in front of you		Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbXkW-zw7fw					Reverse 3 beat	Buzzsaw		https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkPos3Bp_lU
Reverse 3 beat	2	Similar to the 3 beat weave, but in reverse	This is the only move that has a "reverse" page because it is usually the first move you learn in reverse. Almost every move after this has a reverse version.

Windmill	2	A two beat weave done above the head in wall plane	Because this is one of the first moves that is learned in wall plane, it will take time to get used to spinning your poi without slanting	One of the most difficult parts of this move is getting it into split time. Count beats in your head if it helps.	Most of the move should be done through wrist movement	You can do same time shoulder reels first, and then purposely let the timing unsync untill you get into split time (applies to hip reels in watermill)	Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKdWI3PYqGs	Drexfactor (1 min)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmwQYLokqNA	Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o_kPvsXgqA	Corkscrew	Fountain	Vitruvian	https://www.youtube.com/embed/C45qgsE9gyE

Fountain	3	A combination of the forward and reverse 3 beat and windmill	A difficult part of this move is the transition from r3b to windmill. If you end your r3b in front of you, the windmill should start behind you and vice versa.	Spend as much time as you need at each section of the fountain. You can always cut down how long you spend at each part as you get more comfortable.

Frontals	4	A 3 petal antispin flower done with each hand, pointed outwards from the center	Frontals are a two downbeat move. If you count when the poi faces downwards (6 o'clock) you should be able to count 2 per cycle.	Frontals are one of the first moves people learn that allow them to practice against a wall; if you do so managing planes becomes way easier.

Triquetra	5	A 3 petal antispin flower hybrid with an extension	Draw an equilateral triangle with your hand and make sure to accentuate the top petal	Focus on always having equidistance from your belly button to either bottom petal. At first, it will result in smaller triquetras, but when you are more comfortable you can increase the size of the pattern.

4 Petal Antispin	5	A 4 petal antispin flower that hits each cardinal direction	The most important part of this move is to make sure that each cardinal direction is properly aligned	It may help to practice in front of a mirror	4 petal antispins have 3 downbeats, similar to how a triquetra has 2 downbeats.

Orbital	6	Both poi tangle and are pulled to create a fast spinning buzzsaw	The point at which the strings tangle should be the same distance from the poi/handle	If you look at orbitals/ airwraps/ hyperloops from the side, you will notice that the poi paths arent parallel. One poi is slightly skewed so that theres a greater chance of the poi being able to cross paths and initiate the tangle.

Crosser Frontals	6	Two antispin flowers spinning in the same direction that cross over and extend back	Much of the difficulty from this move comes from the potential of the poi hitting each other or tangling.

Triquetra vs Static Spin	6	Triquetras that follow the hand path of a static spin	You need to be comfortable with performing extremely fast triquetras	 The static spinning poi follows the same path as the triquetra arm (both the arm and the poi should be right next to each other)			Drexfactor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKseM3H9dH4					Triquetra			https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6S3D-gyyCw
Hyperloop	7	An extended airwrap	The point at which the strings tangle should be the same distance from the poi/handle	You can sustain the tangle by rotating your arms in the same direction the poi are moving	If you spin slower than normal, the extry + exit motion becomes easier to process (it usually happens p fast)		Playpoi	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8AuO1feUE	Drexfactor (1 min)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsu2cPelfmw			Airwrap			a

2 beat	2	One of the basic moves; the staff makes 2 down beats on each side of the arm. Has both forward and reverse directions.	Count each time an end of the staff passes your arm; there should be two consecutive passes on each side of the arm	Divide the move into 4 postitions: (thumb end inside far, pinky end outside close), (thumb end inside close, pinky end outside far), (thumb end outside far, pinky end inside close), (thumb end outside close pinky end inside far)	Keep your arm as straight as possible so that you don't hit yourself.

Leg Lacing	3	A beginner move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. Same mechanic and concept as a torso lace but reflected on 1) a leg or 2) both legs	You are essentially taking a body lace and transferring to a leg, your hand movements stay the same or similar!

Cross Leg Lacing	3	A beginner transition from one leg to the other. Feels like you are weaving the whip back and forth. 	Remember the concept of the Open Torso Position, the Open Position can be used in any type of lacing move; when you are able to go to Open position, you will be able to move your hands and close on another body part to finish your transition!

Arm Lacing 	1	Lacing around the arm consistently															
Neck Lacing	5	An intermediate move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. This has a variety of ways to be performed. Essentially a lace around the neck.	To make this move look snazzier, we usually use the elbow lace to transition into the neck lace and raise our elbows again to transition out of this move.

Torso Lacing	3	A beginner move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. This move is extremely important and central to all Body-Lacing moves. A basic/smooth wrap around the waist.	It is important to NOT let go of the whip handle; the handle should always stay in your dominant hand.	Make sure you are attentive visually; you may think you are doing the right thing when you aren't.	Once you can do lace by gripping with your fingers, slowly transition to lacing with your WRIST; this will create for smoother/flowier laces.
