2 beat	2	One of the basic moves; the staff makes 2 down beats on each side of the arm. Has both forward and reverse directions.	Count each time an end of the staff passes your arm; there should be two consecutive passes on each side of the arm	Divide the move into 4 postitions: (thumb end inside far, pinky end outside close), (thumb end inside close, pinky end outside far), (thumb end outside far, pinky end inside close), (thumb end outside close pinky end inside far)	Keep your arm as straight as possible so that you don't hit yourself.
