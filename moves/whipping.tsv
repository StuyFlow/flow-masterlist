Leg Lacing	3	A beginner move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. Same mechanic and concept as a torso lace but reflected on 1) a leg or 2) both legs	You are essentially taking a body lace and transferring to a leg, your hand movements stay the same or similar! Don't overthink it	Once you have learned your torso and leg lace, practice transitioning to and from both.

Cross Leg Lacing	3	A beginner transition from one leg to the other. Feels like you are weaving the whip back and forth. 	Remember the concept of the Open Torso Position, the Open Position can be used in any type of lacing move; when you are able to go to Open position, you will be able to move your hands and close on another body part to finish your transition!

Elbow Lacing	1	A beginner move which is mostly used as a transition around the body in which you lace the whip up your arm and around the elbow.	This is mainly used to transition from your torso lace to upper-body laces in a smooth manner				Fiberflies	https://youtu.be/Brg2U10vPXc								https://www.youtube.com/embed/D77Hp9WdR5g	Body-Lacing
Arm Lacing 	1	Lacing around the arm consistently															
Neck Lacing	5	An intermediate move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. This has a variety of ways to be performed. Essentially a lace around the neck.	To make this move look snazzier, we usually use the elbow lace to transition into the neck lace and raise our elbows again to transition out of this move.

Torso Lacing	3	A beginner move in the "Body-Lacing" skillset. This move is extremely important and central to all Body-Lacing moves. A basic/smooth wrap around the waist.	It is important to NOT let go of the whip handle; the handle should always stay in your dominant hand.	Make sure you are attentive visually; you may think you are doing the right thing when you aren't.	Once you can do lace by gripping with your fingers, slowly transition to lacing with your WRIST; this will create for smoother/flowier laces.

Knee Lacing	5	A lace around a bent-knee while kicking out when the time is right to create a mix between a lace and a lash	Repeat the move to see when the timing is good for you! 	Make sure you tuck/bend your knee to the extreme so the whip can wrap well			Fiberflies	https://youtu.be/o37DvJ6gzvI								https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gi_se3dzFKE	Body-Lacing/Whiplash

Advanced Movesets and Freestyle	10	There are SO many moves in the Whipping category! It's impossible to give a name and tutorial on each. The cool thing about whipping is EVERYTHING is interwoven and connected!

The biggest thing is confidence within yourself--that is the only way you'll be able to freestyle and make your own routine!
