Beginner	Planes. Imagine if you were in a box. The walls are what we refer to as planes. For a majority of staffing moves, you should focus on your front and back planes. If you spin on the side, the audience will most likely only see a straight line. That's not as pretty or cool as a circle. So keep a majority of the movement parallel to the front and back planes.	Straighten your arm, especially for moves based around 2 beat. You don't want to hit yourself and get it tangled in your clothes. 
Intermediate	Practice getting more height in your tosses. This will give you more time to react.
