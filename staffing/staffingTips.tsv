Beginner	Planes. Imagine if you were in a box. The walls are what we refer to as planes. For a majority of staffing moves, you should focus on your front and back planes. If you spin on the side, the audience will most likely only see a straight line. That's not as pretty or cool as a circle. So keep a majority of the movement parallel to the front and back planes.	Straighten your arm, especially for moves based around 2 beat. You don't want to hit yourself and get it tangled in your clothes. 	Make sure your wrist and hand is as flexible as possible. Don't grip the staff too firmly but grip it enough to where you can control the movement of the staff while still providing room for it to rotate.
Intermediate	Practice getting more height in your tosses. This will give you more time to react.	For isolations and moves that require isolations focus on keepings the staff still while move your arm. Focus on keeping on point of the staff in the same position and roatating the other end around that point, like drawing a circle with a compass.	The wrist is very important for more difficult moves like higher tosses, more complex spins and faster rotations. Your wrist has to be nice and loose when you're staffing, otherwise it will be hard to keep up fluidity and speed as moves and chores get more complex. Practice beginner movements like 3 beat and such when you're at this level, but with emphasis on the movement of your wrist as you do it to get the type of fluidity you're looking for.
Advanced	If you want to learn double staffing moves it is recommend to practice with one arm at a time, familiarizing what position your arm and hand should be at a certain point in the move. Something to help with this would be to keep track of which end of the staff is pointed in which direction.	Emphasize technique over speed always when you're learning a new move. It's very easy to get caught up in how fast you can spin a staff, but speed is nothing without the technique to back it. Besides, once you master the technique, you'll find that going faster with moves actually becomes easier!	Your arms and wrist need decent strength to perform a lot of advanced moves well, so don't get disheartened if there's a certain move you just can't do well yet. Practicing some high tosses or doing small arm workouts will help in the long run as you gain movement stability through increased strength.
